//! THE RATCHET: no internal identifier gets back into this public repo.
//!
//! A scrub is a STATE and states rot. This repo was scrubbed of 41 internal
//! hostnames and paths; without a mechanism, number 42 arrives within days from
//! someone writing a perfectly good doc. The deliverable was never the 41
//! strings — it is this test.
//!
//! IT SCANS BYTES, NOT JUST TEXT FILES, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.
//! `data/quipu.db` sat tracked in this repo carrying ~2.1MB of a live private
//! graph — several thousand internal service and host names — and the sweep
//! written to find exactly that missed it, because scanners skip binaries by
//! suffix. The file was invisible to the tool designed to find it. So this reads
//! every tracked file as raw bytes and matches the lossy decode: a database, a
//! log or a compiled blob cannot hide from it.
//!
//! NO LOOKAROUNDS. Rust's `regex` is RE2-flavoured and has none, which is also
//! why the graph rule's patterns are written RE2-compatible: the same pattern
//! strings have to run in a Rust consumer and a Python one. Where a negative
//! condition is needed, capture and filter in code instead.
//!
//! SCOPE: an offline subset of the authoritative rule, which lives in the Quipu
//! knowledge graph. Duplicated here in part, on purpose — a public repo's test
//! suite must name no internal service and must pass with no network. To change
//! WHAT is forbidden, change the graph rule, not this file.
